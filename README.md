  This is a simple node.js application that allows the user to generate a README file from the console. The skeleton of this README is generated using this application!

  ## Installation
  Node.js and the Inquirer package from NPM are required to use this application.

  Follow the instructions at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to download and install Node.js.

  Once Node.js is installed, you can install the Inquirer package by first initialising NPM in the local folder, you can do this via the "npm init -y" command on console, and then installing Inquirer by using the "npm i inquirer" command.

  ## Usage
  Please open the console, and use the command "node index.js" and follow the prompts.

  Your generated readme file will be in the output folder. Please note - running a new instance of readme generator will override the old readme file in output. To avoid deleting previous readme files, move those generated files out of the output folder before generating a new readme.

  Here is a video walkthrough of using the application:

  ## License
  This application is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 license. Please refer to the license file for more information.

  ## Contributing
  Feel free to take this code and build something else. This is a relatively simple project so I will not be updating it!

  ## Tests
  To run a rest, simply boot up the application using "node index.js", and give a 1 word description for each section (i.e. Title for the title section, Description for the description section), chose the second license and enter a random Github url and email! Then go to the output folder to check the output.
